                <h3>hi, i'm breanna.</h3>
                
                <p>Nice to meet you, and thanks for visiting my portfolio! I’m a 20-year-old photographer and student based out of Toronto, Canada. Currently, you can find me in Waterloo studying Communications at Wilfred Laurier University. Growing up, I’ve always had a huge passion for photography. As I’ve learned more about it throughout the years, I’ve been able to expand my creativity and refine my style. As you could probably tell, I love shooting the environment. I’ve caught the travel bug, so I have a large collection of photos that reflect my experiences abroad. While I enjoy documenting my travels, my favorite thing to shoot is portraits. Most of them are shot in clean and organic environments; I try to have a very simplistic, soft tone to my work in order to enhance the natural beauty of the scenery and my subjects. I’m very proud of the photographs I’ve been able to take thus far, and I hope you can enjoy them as much as I do!</p>
                
                <p>If you have any business inquiries, please feel free to contact me directly using the email information below, I’d be happy to chat with you! If you want to see more of me, you can check out my main social media channels, also linked below.</p>
